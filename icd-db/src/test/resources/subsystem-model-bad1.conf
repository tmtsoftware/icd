description = """
The Wide Field Optical Spectrometer (WFOS) will provide near-ultraviolet and optical
(0.3 – 1.0 μm wavelength) imaging and spectroscopy over a more than 40 square arcminute
field-of-view. Using precision cut focal plane masks, WFOS will enable long-slit observations
of single objects as well as short-slit observations of hundreds of objects simultaneously.
WFOS will use natural (uncorrected) seeing images.
