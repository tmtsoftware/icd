  // Event Categories:

  // DEMAND = an event that is used to transmit a desired position.
  // These events are high frequency/periodic and should not be archived long-term or
  // should be seriously curated into a smaller representative collection.
  //
  // CONTROL = similar to a DEMAND, but probably not periodic and considerably less frequent.
  // CONTROL events are events driving other devices, but may be internal to a system. These also may be curated.
  //
  // EVENT = an event is used to indicate that something has happened.  Observe Events are one EVENT type.
  //
  // STATUS = a STATUS  event is used primarily to update a user interface.
  // These events are archived.  They are not high frequency and are not periodic.
