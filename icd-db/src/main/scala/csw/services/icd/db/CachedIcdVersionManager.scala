 * Adds caching to IcdVersionManager for better performance when creating documents or web pages that

 *
 * This version only caches the collection names. You can pass a CachedIcdDbQuery instance
 * to cache a lot more information. In tests, the collectionExists method was found to be a bottleneck.
 *
 * @param query may be used to share caching of collection names (see CachedIcdDbQuery)
