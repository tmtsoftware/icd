description="""
The communication between AOESW and IRIS (including its OIWFS) will be done primarily via the TMT Control LAN (TBC) utilizing the CSW Event and Command services.  The following points summarize the CSW interfaces.AOSQ sends the following commands to IRIS assemblies involved in AO:

*	“phasing” command to the Instrument Rotator when it is initially energized;
*	“datum” commands to home positioning mechanisms in the IRIS OIWFS ADCs, OIWFS Probes, and the Instrument Rotator;
*	 “move” commands to positioning mechanisms in the IRIS OIWFS Probes, and the Instrument Rotator, to support calibration activities and to prime mechanisms prior to observations;
*	“setAdcDispersion” command to the IRIS OIWFS ADC, to support calibration activities, and to prime the ADCs prior to observations;
*	“stop” commands to halt any active behaviors of the IRIS OIWFS ADCs, OIWFS Probes, OIWFS Detectors, Instrument Rotator, and Imager ODGWs;
*	“park” commands to the IRIS OIWFS ADCs, OIWFS Probes, and Instrument Rotator, to place moving mechanisms into a safe maintenance/servicing position (e.g., at the end of the night) ;
*	“follow” command to the IRIS OIWFS ADCs to activate continuous adjustment of the ADCs based on atmospheric dispersion information published by the TCS;
*	“select” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to configure the optical mode (TT / TTF);
*	“offset” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to configure static offsets to the probe positions (e.g., to account for guide star catalog position errors);
*	“active” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to inform the OIWFS which probes are being actively used by the AO system so that any motion of non-active probes does not interfere with the active probes;
*	“follow” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to activate continuous positional adjustments based on guide star positions published by the TCS;
*	“filter” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to configure the parameters of an optional low-pass filter on the guide star position streams published by the TCS;
*	“trackingType” command to the IRIS OIWFS Probes to configure the tracking type (on-chip vs. mechanical motion, and whether the telescope is dithering);
*	“follow” command to the IRIS Instrument Rotator to activate continuous adjustment of the rotator angle based on positions published by the TCS;
*	“cal_config” commands to the IRIS OIWFS Detector and Imager ODGW to configure calibration information for wavefront sensor imager processing;
*	“cal_exposure” command to the IRIS OIWFS Detector to take (and optionally process) a sequence of calibration exposures (i.e., to produce DARK and FLAT images);
*	“init_acquisition_table” commands to the IRIS OIWFS Detector and Imager ODGW to upload new Guide and Acquisition Tables;
*	“exposure” commands to the IRIS OIWFS Detector and Imager ODGW to configure the exposure mode (i.e., “CONTINUOUS” to engage continuous exposures with timing specified by the NFIRAOS trigger, and “STOP” to halt exposures) – note that like the OIWFS Probes, the Imager ODGW window positions will continuously follow guide star positions published by the TCS when in the “CONTINUOUS” mode;
*	“table_jump” commands to the IRIS OIWFS Detector and Imager ODGW to start at the specified lines of the Guide and Acquisition Table for the next exposure when the wavefront sensor is in the “CONTINUOUS” mode;
*	“filter” command to the IRIS Imager ODGW to configure the parameters of an optional low-pass filter on the guide star position streams published by the TCS.

AOSQ subscribes to a number of events published by IRIS assemblies involved in AO:

*	“state” events from the IRIS OIWFS ADC, OIWFS Probes, OIWFS Detector, Instrument Rotator, and Imager ODGW to monitor their overall states;
*	“trackingType” event from the IRIS OIWFS Probes to verify that the OIWFS is operating in the requested tracking mode;
*	“followType” event from the IRIS OIWFS Probes to verify that the OIWFS is operating in the requested following mode;
*	“current” events for the IRIS OIWFS Detector, Instrument Rotator, and Imager ODGW to determine whether their positions are correct.

RPG subscribes to several events published by IRIS assemblies to assist in the calculation of control matrices:

*	“current” angle of the IRIS Instrument Rotator;
*	“current” positions of the IRIS OIWFS Probes and detector readout windows;
*	“current” positions of the IRIS Image ODGW readout windows;
*	“current” IRIS Imager Filter setting (i.e., wavelength);
*	“referenceVectors” specifying corrections that must be applied to IRIS OIWFS and Imager ODGW guide star gradients.
