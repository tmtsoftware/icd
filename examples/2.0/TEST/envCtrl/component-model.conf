Here is an example using LaTeX math: $`\frac{d}{dx}\left( \int_{0}^{x} f(u)\,du\right)=f(x)`$.
And here is another: $`[x^n + y^n = z^n]`$.

This is a math block:

```math
$$\idotsint_V \mu(u_1,\dots,u_k) \,du_1 \dots du_k$$
```

and another:

```math
\[E=mc^2\]
```

And here is an example of UML markup using PlantUML:

```uml
@startuml
scale 5 as 150 pixels

clock clk with period 1
binary "enable" as en
binary "R/W" as rw
binary "data Valid" as dv
concise "dataBus" as db
concise "address bus" as addr

@6 as :write_beg
@10 as :write_end

@15 as :read_beg
@19 as :read_end


@0
en is low
db is "0x0"
addr is "0x03f"
rw is low
dv is 0

@:write_beg-3
 en is high
@:write_beg-2
 db is "0xDEADBEEF"
@:write_beg-1
dv is 1
@:write_beg
rw is high


@:write_end
rw is low
dv is low
@:write_end+1
rw is low
db is "0x0"
addr is "0x23"

@12
dv is high
@13
db is "0xFFFF"

@20
en is low
dv is low
@21
db is "0x0"

highlight :write_beg to :write_end #Gold:Write
highlight :read_beg to :read_end #lightBlue:Read

db@:write_beg-1 <-> @:write_end : setup time
db@:write_beg-1 -> addr@:write_end+1 : hold
@enduml
```

and another UML diagram:

```uml
@startuml
[*] -> State1
State1 --> State2 : Succeeded
State1 --> [*] : Aborted
State2 --> State3 : Succeeded
State2 --> [*] : Aborted
state State3 {
  state "Accumulate Enough Data" as long1
  long1 : Just a test
  [*] --> long1
  long1 --> long1 : New Data
  long1 --> ProcessData : Enough Data
  State2 --> [H]: Resume
}
State3 --> State2 : Pause
State2 --> State3[H*]: DeepResume
State3 --> State3 : Failed
State3 --> [*] : Succeeded / Save Result
State3 --> [*] : Aborted
