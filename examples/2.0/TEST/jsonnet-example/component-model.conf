This example component shows how you can optionally have some
 model files with the ".jsonnet" suffix that use the [jsonnet](https://jsonnet.org/learning/tutorial.html)
 syntax instead of the HOCON ([typesafe config](https://github.com/lightbend/config)) syntax.
 Model files with the ".jsonnet" suffix are preprocessed with jsonnet to produce the actual icd model files.
