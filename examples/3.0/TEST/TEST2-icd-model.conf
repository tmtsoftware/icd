subsystem = TEST
title = "About the ICD between TEST and TEST2"
description = """
This part contains extra information relevant to the TEST-TEST2 ICD.
For each subsystem with which this subsystem has an ICD, you can optionally add a model file named *subsystemName*-icd.conf in the top level directory for this subsystem's API model files. Later, when an ICD is generated for these two subsystems, this information will be included near the top. If the other subsystem also includes such a file for this subsystem, that information will also be appended.

You can use the usual icd `Markdown` features, including:

* GitHub style markdown

* Math markup: $`[x^n + y^n = z^n]`$

* Plantuml blocks

* Graphviz blocks

For example, here is a math formula:

```math
A_{m,n} =
 \begin{pmatrix}
  a_{1,1} & a_{1,2} & \cdots & a_{1,n} \\
  a_{2,1} & a_{2,2} & \cdots & a_{2,n} \\
  \vdots  & \vdots  & \ddots & \vdots  \\
  a_{m,1} & a_{m,2} & \cdots & a_{m,n}
 \end{pmatrix}
```

and here is a UML diagram:

```uml
[*] -> State1
State1 --> State2 : Succeeded
State1 --> [*] : Aborted
State2 --> State3 : Succeeded
State2 --> [*] : Aborted
state State3 {
  state "Accumulate Enough Data" as long1
  long1 : Just a test
  [*] --> long1
  long1 --> long1 : New Data
  long1 --> ProcessData : Enough Data
  State2 --> [H]: Resume
}
State3 --> State2 : Pause
State2 --> State3[H*]: DeepResume
State3 --> State3 : Failed
State3 --> [*] : Succeeded / Save Result
State3 --> [*] : Aborted
```

The UML and math blocks will be displayed correctly in the generated ICD.
