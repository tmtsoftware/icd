       *Discussion: For sidereal tracking, the maximum rotation velocity of ADC prisms caused by the orientation change (= the change rate of the parallactic angle) is 0.225 deg/s, which happens when observing a target that transits 1 degree south from the zenith. The current required position accuracy is [+/- 0.28 deg](https://docushare.tmt.org/docushare/dsweb/Get/Document-57487/DN%20IRIS.IMG.ADC_REL01.pdf), so 1 Hz of update rate should be enough. If IRIS will need finer time granuality to frequently control the mechanisms, IRIS software should perform interpolation internally using the new event and the past events. If we really need to increase the update rate of this event in the future for better accuracy, there are two options: increase the update rate of this telemetry, or split "orientation" attribute into a separate event because the rotation velocity caused by the atmospheric correction is likely to be much slower than the velocity caused by the orientation change.*

This event shall be published, at least, one tick before the time indicated by "timestamp" attribute to allow IRIS to perform interpolation of "orientation". Considering the calculation time to perform interpolation and margin for communication & software delay, it should be one more tick before, hence two ticks in total.*
