description = """
The communication, software and control interfaces between NFIRAOS and IRIS consist of the following:

*	Transfer of pixel compression gain and offset coefficients from the OIWFS detector controller to the NRTC.
*	Transfer of pixel compression gain and offset coefficients from the IRIS Imager detector controller to the NRTC.
*	Transfer of residual field rotation angle OIWFS from the NFIRAOS RTC to the IRIS SRO.
*	Transfer of the IRIS OIWFS ADC ellipticity correction streams from the NFIRAOS RTC to the IRIS SRO. The corrections include the widths of the elliptical Gaussian image and angle between the ellipse axis and the local X axis.
*	Transfer of the IRIS OIWFS pixels from the IRIS OIWFS detector controllers to the NFIRAOS RTC.
*	Transfer of the IRIS ODGW pixels from the IRIS detector controllers to the NFIRAOS RTC.
*	Transfer of probe position errors due to TT offloading from the NFIRAOS RTC to the IRIS SRO.
*	Transfer of the NFIRAOS Optical Enclosure state to the OIWFS Enclosure.
*	Bi-directional sharing of respective temperatures of NFIRAOS and OIWFS enclosures
*	Transfer of NFIRAOS configuration, state, and performance information to the IRIS Data Reduction System (DRS).
